# **Core Directives & Priorities**

1.  **Security First:** All code you generate MUST be secure. Prioritise security best practices in all layers of the application.
2.  **Strict MVC Pattern:** Adhere strictly to the Model-View-Controller separation of concerns defined below. Never mix logic between these layers.
3.  **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** All new business logic in models or controllers MUST be accompanied by corresponding unit tests.
4.  **Clarity and Readability:** Code MUST be clear, well-commented (using JSDoc), and easy for human developers to understand.
