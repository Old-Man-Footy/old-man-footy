/**
 * Remove Database Input Validations Migration
 * 
 * This migration documents the removal of all database-level input validations
 * from the Old Man Footy platform models, following MVC architecture best practices
 * where input validation is handled at the UI/Controller layers instead of the database.
 * 
 * Changes Made:
 * 1. User Model - Removed email validation, length constraints on names
 * 2. Club Model - Removed email, URL, length, and state validations
 * 3. Carnival Model - Removed email, URL, date, state, and numeric validations
 * 4. Sponsor Model - Removed email, URL, length, and state validations
 * 5. EmailSubscription Model - Removed email and states array validations
 * 6. CarnivalClub Model - Removed length, email, and numeric min/max validations
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * - Better separation of concerns (MVC pattern)
 * - More flexible data import from external sources (MySideline)
 * - Better user experience with immediate UI feedback
 * - Cleaner database schema focused on data storage
 * 
 * Note: This is a documentation-only migration. The actual validation removal
 * was done directly in the model files. No database schema changes are required
 * as we only removed Sequelize model validations, not database constraints.

     * 3. Test that all existing data still passes the restored validations
