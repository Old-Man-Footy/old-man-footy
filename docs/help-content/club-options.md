# Club Options â€” Help Content

## Club Name
Choose a clear and descriptive club name. Avoid abbreviations where possible so people can find your club. Use the autocomplete to find existing clubs before creating a new one.

## State
Select the Australian state or territory where your club is based. This helps others filter and find clubs in their region.

## Description
Write a short summary (one or two sentences) describing the club. This appears on search results and the club profile to help visitors understand the club at a glance.

## Create vs Join
If you find an existing club using the autocomplete, prefer joining rather than creating a duplicate. Creating a club makes you the primary delegate with full management privileges.
