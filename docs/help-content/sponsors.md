# Sponsors â€” Help Content

## What is a Sponsor?
Sponsors support carnivals and clubs financially or with in-kind support. Use the sponsor form to add logos, description, and contact info.

## Visibility
Sponsors can be set as publicly visible; this controls whether they appear on public pages and search results.

## Logo Requirements
Upload logos in PNG or JPEG format. Recommended size: 300x150px. Keep file sizes under 200KB for faster page loads.
