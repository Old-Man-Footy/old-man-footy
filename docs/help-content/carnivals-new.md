# Carnival Creation â€” Help Content

## Imported from MySideline
Fields marked "Imported from MySideline" are synced from the MySideline source record and may be read-only until you claim ownership of the event. Common imported fields:

- Title / Name
- Dates
- Location (address components may vary)
- Registration links (if provided by MySideline)

## Local fields
Fields that are editable locally will be clearly labelled. After claiming a MySideline event some fields become editable; others remain linked to the external record.

## Best practices
- Verify dates and venues after import.
- Add a short description and images to help participants.
- Use the registration settings to control fees and deadlines.
