# Contextual Help Popups Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of a contextual help system. The previous approach of using multiple popups per page has been replaced. The new direction is to implement a **single, global "Help" button** with a question mark icon in the main navigation menu (the site's chrome).

When a user clicks this button, a modal window will open, displaying help content specifically tailored to the page they are currently viewing. This provides a centralized, predictable help mechanism while ensuring the content remains contextually relevant. Help content will be stored in and retrieved from a central database table.

## Paths verification & route-to-view mapping

- [x] Verify each planned URL (route) actually renders a server-side view or client page before creating help content.
- [x] Maintain the `docs/plans/help-route-to-view.md` mapping document that lists each route and the view it corresponds to. This will be the source-of-truth for creating `PageIdentifier` keys for the database.

Note: The repository contains route files that include API endpoints and image management POST/DELETE routes that are not pages (for example `/api/maintenance/status`, `/clubs/:clubId/images`). These should be excluded.

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Technical Architecture
- **Global Help Button**: A single help button (`<button>` or `<a>`) with a question mark icon (`bi bi-question-circle`) will be placed in the main application layout (`views/layout.ejs`).
- **Modal System**: A single, reusable Bootstrap modal will be defined in the main layout. Its content will be dynamically populated.
- **Content Management**: Help content will be stored in a new `HelpContent` table in the database. An API endpoint (e.g., `/api/help/:pageIdentifier`) will be created to fetch content.
- **JavaScript Management**: A central JavaScript module (`public/js/help-system.js`) will handle the click event on the global help button. It will identify the current page, fetch the relevant content from the API, and display it in the modal.
- **Accessibility**: The modal will support full ARIA standards, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.
- **Mobile Optimization**: The modal will be responsive, appearing full-screen on mobile devices.

### 2. Help Content Guidelines
- **Comprehensiveness**: Each page's help content should cover all major features and functions available on that page.
- **Conciseness**: Use clear headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs. Aim for 100-400 words per page.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Use accordions or expandable sections within the modal for complex pages if necessary.
- **Visual Aids**: Include screenshots or diagrams where helpful.
- **Actionable**: End with clear next steps or links to related functions.

## Progress update (2025-08-29)

Current status: The project direction has been updated. The initial skeleton will be refactored to support the new single-modal approach.

- [~] **RE-SCOPED**: The central modal partial (`views/partials/help-modal.ejs`) will be moved into the main layout (`views/layout.ejs`) as a single global instance.
- [~] **RE-SCOPED**: The central help manager (`public/js/help-system.js`) will be refactored to remove per-trigger logic. It will now manage the global help button, fetch content via API based on a page identifier, and populate the single modal.
- [x] The routeâ†’view mapping document (`docs/plans/help-route-to-view.md`) remains valid and will be used for content mapping.
- [-] **DEPRECATED**: Example page wiring for `club-options`, `carnivals/new`, etc., will be removed.
- [-] **DEPRECATED**: Page-specific help-config modules (`public/js/help-config-*.js`) are no longer needed.
- [x] Help-content markdown stubs (`docs/help-content/*.md`) will be used as the source material for populating the new database table.
- [x] **NEW**: Create the `HelpContent` database table and write a migration script.
- [x] **NEW**: Create an API endpoint to fetch help content by `pageIdentifier`.
- [x] **NEW**: Refactor the JavaScript help system to support the new global button and API.
- [x] **NEW**: Add a `data-page-id` attribute to the `<body>` tag of each view to inform the JavaScript which page is active.
- [x] Continue populating the `HelpContent` table for all pages per the Page-by-Page plan (initial 8 pages complete).
- [x] Add unit/integration tests for the new `helpSystem` and API endpoint.

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Help System Architecture
```javascript
// Central help configuration
const helpSystem = {
  pages: {
    'club-options': {
      'create-club-form': {
        title: 'Creating Your Club',
        content: '...',
        position: 'right',
        trigger: '#clubName'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Modal Template Structure
```html
<div class="help-modal modal fade" id="help-{page}-{section}" tabindex="-1">
  <div class="modal-dialog modal-lg">
    <div class="modal-content">
      <div class="modal-header">
        <h5 class="modal-title">
          <i class="bi bi-question-circle text-primary me-2"></i>
          {Help Title}
        </h5>
        <button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal"></button>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        {Help Content}
      </div>
      <div class="modal-footer">
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Got it</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### 3. Icon Placement Strategy
- **Form Fields**: Right side of input groups
- **Buttons**: Top-right corner of button containers
- **Sections**: Top-right of section headers
- **Cards**: Top-right of card headers
- **Tables**: Right side of table captions

### 4. Mobile-Specific Considerations
- **Icon Sizing**: Minimum 24px icons on mobile
- **Touch Zones**: 44px minimum touch targets
- **Modal Behavior**: Full-screen on small screens
- **Positioning**: Avoid bottom navigation areas
- **Gestures**: Support swipe-to-dismiss

### 5. Accessibility Features
- **ARIA Labels**: Proper labeling for screen readers
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order and Enter/Space activation
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus trapping in modals
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliance
- **Alternative Text**: Descriptive alt text for icons

### 6. Content Management
- **Markdown Support**: Allow rich text formatting
- **Image Integration**: Support for screenshots/diagrams
- **Version Control**: Track help content versions
- **A/B Testing**: Test different help content effectiveness
- **Analytics**: Track help usage and effectiveness

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Create help modal system
- [ ] Implement help icon component
- [ ] Set up content management structure
- [ ] Add mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Implement accessibility features

## Global / Site chrome help

- [ ] Add a global "site chrome" help icon (in the main layout: `views/layout.ejs`), which opens a small modal explaining global navigation items: account menu, notifications, search, and where to find contextual help on each page.
- [ ] Ensure the global help modal is optional and lightweight â€” it should link to page-specific help popups rather than duplicate them.

## Non-UI / API routes (do not add popups)

The codebase contains several routes that are API endpoints, image-management or POST actions which do not have their own rendered page and therefore should not receive dedicated help popups. Instead, surface guidance on the pages where these features are used.

Examples to exclude from per-page popup scanning (verify in `routes/` before implementing):
- `/api/maintenance/status` and `/api/coming-soon/status` (status APIs)
- `/health` (health check endpoint)
- `/clubs/api/search` or `/clubs/api/search`-style autocomplete endpoints (back-end search)
- `/clubs/:clubId/images` and `DELETE /:clubId/images/:filename` (image management endpoints)
- `/clubs/join/:id`, `/clubs/leave` (POST actions â€” surface help on the club list/profile UI)
- Many `POST` routes used for form submissions (create/update/delete) â€” implement help on the form pages only, not the POST endpoints themselves.

If a route is purely an AJAX endpoint, add help to the parent page that consumes that endpoint (for example: autocomplete help on the form that uses `/clubs/api/search`).

### Phase 2: Public Pages (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Homepage help popups
- [ ] About page help popups
