# Contextual Help Popups Implementation Plan

## Overview
Replace the centralized user guide with contextual help popups throughout the application. Each help popup will be triggered by question mark icons (?) placed strategically near relevant UI elements, opening modals with specific, detailed instructions for that particular feature or task.

## Paths verification & route-to-view mapping

 - [x] Verify each planned URL (route) actually renders a server-side view or client page before creating help popups. Some Express routes are API-only or perform redirects and should not receive UI popups (see "Non-UI / API routes" below).  
 - [x] Create a short mapping document `docs/plans/help-route-to-view.md` that lists each route and the view file (or API) it corresponds to. This will be the source-of-truth for implementation.  
 - [ ] For any route that currently uses partials only (for example via AJAX), create a plan for where the help icon should live (calling page or modal parent), or mark it as deferred.

Note: The repository contains route files that include API endpoints and image management POST/DELETE routes that are not pages (for example `/api/maintenance/status`, `/clubs/:clubId/images` and image delete endpoints). These should be excluded when building the per-page help popups; instead, consider adding admin-facing guidance in the relevant management pages where those features are surfaced.

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Technical Architecture
- **Modal System**: Use Bootstrap modals for consistent styling and behavior
- **Icon Placement**: Question mark icons using Bootstrap Icons (`bi bi-question-circle`)
- **JavaScript Management**: Centralized help system with page-specific configurations
- **Accessibility**: Full ARIA support, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly sizing, proper viewport handling

### 2. Help Content Guidelines
- **Specificity**: Each popup explains one specific task or feature
- **Conciseness**: Keep content focused and actionable (50-200 words per popup)
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with basics, offer "Learn More" for advanced details
- **Visual Aids**: Include screenshots or diagrams where helpful
- **Actionable**: End with clear next steps or "Try It" buttons

### 3. Mobile Responsiveness Best Practices
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets for help icons
- **Modal Sizing**: Full-screen modals on mobile, max-width on desktop
- **Positioning**: Icons positioned to avoid thumb interference zones
- **Gestures**: Support swipe-to-dismiss for modals
- **Font Sizing**: Minimum 16px readable text, scalable with device settings

## Page-by-Page Implementation Plan

## Progress update (2025-08-29)

Current status: initial skeleton implemented and example pages wired. Use this section to track concrete tasks already completed so the team can monitor rollout progress.

- [x] Central modal partial supporting multiple instances implemented (`views/partials/help-modal.ejs`).
- [x] Central help manager updated to support per-trigger modal targeting and legacy default (`public/js/help-system.js`).
- [x] Routeâ†’view mapping document created and verified (`docs/plans/help-route-to-view.md`).
- [x] Example page wiring completed for: `club-options` (help triggers + config), `carnivals/new` (MySideline badges + help triggers + config), `index` (modal include + config), `clubs/manage` (modal include + config), `sponsors/list` (modal include + config).
- [x] Page-specific help-config modules added under `public/js/help-config-*.js` for the example pages.
- [x] Help-content markdown stubs created under `docs/help-content/` for: `club-options.md`, `carnivals-new.md`, `index.md`, `clubs.md`, `sponsors.md`.
- [ ] Continue wiring pages across the site per the Page-by-Page plan (next target: Carnival detail/edit pages and remaining Club flows).
- [ ] Decide and implement scalable runtime content-loading (fetch markdown/JSON) vs inline page configs.
- [ ] Add unit/integration tests for `helpSystem` (multi-modal behaviour, event emission, accessibility checks).

Notes:
- The pattern implemented uses a small page config module (`public/js/help-config-<page>.js`) that sets `window.HELP_SYSTEM_CONFIG.pages['<page-id>']` and initializes the `helpSystem`. This is intentionally lightweight and easy to copy when authoring new pages.
- For each page the remaining work is typically: place `data-help-key` triggers next to target UI elements, include a modal instance in the view with a unique `modalId`, and create/author the page config module or server-render the help config into `window.HELP_SYSTEM_CONFIG`.

- [ ] On the carnival public view (`/carnivals/:id`) include a short note explaining which displayed fields came from MySideline and the expected behaviour when a user "takes ownership" of a MySideline event (i.e., which fields become editable and what data remains linked to the MySideline record).
- [ ] Add tests/QA checklist to verify imported field mappings and to surface mismatches (e.g., date format differences, missing address parts).

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Help System Architecture
```javascript
// Central help configuration
const helpSystem = {
  pages: {
    'club-options': {
      'create-club-form': {
        title: 'Creating Your Club',
        content: '...',
        position: 'right',
        trigger: '#clubName'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Modal Template Structure
```html
<div class="help-modal modal fade" id="help-{page}-{section}" tabindex="-1">
  <div class="modal-dialog modal-lg">
    <div class="modal-content">
      <div class="modal-header">
        <h5 class="modal-title">
          <i class="bi bi-question-circle text-primary me-2"></i>
          {Help Title}
        </h5>
        <button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal"></button>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body">
        {Help Content}
      </div>
      <div class="modal-footer">
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Got it</button>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Try It</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### 3. Icon Placement Strategy

- **Buttons**: Top-right corner of button containers
- **Sections**: Top-right of section headers
- **Cards**: Top-right of card headers
- **Tables**: Right side of table captions

### 4. Mobile-Specific Considerations

- **Gestures**: Support swipe-to-dismiss

### 5. Accessibility Features
- **ARIA Labels**: Proper labeling for screen readers
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order and Enter/Space activation
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus trapping in modals
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliance
- **Alternative Text**: Descriptive alt text for icons

### 6. Content Management

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Create help modal system
- [ ] Implement help icon component
- [ ] Set up content management structure
- [ ] Add mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Implement accessibility features

## Global / Site chrome help

- [ ] Add a global "site chrome" help icon (in the main layout: `views/layout.ejs`), which opens a small modal explaining global navigation items: account menu, notifications, search, and where to find contextual help on each page.
- [ ] Ensure the global help modal is optional and lightweight â€” it should link to page-specific help popups rather than duplicate them.

## Non-UI / API routes (do not add popups)

The codebase contains several routes that are API endpoints, image-management or POST actions which do not have their own rendered page and therefore should not receive dedicated help popups. Instead, surface guidance on the pages where these features are used.

Examples to exclude from per-page popup scanning (verify in `routes/` before implementing):
- `/api/maintenance/status` and `/api/coming-soon/status` (status APIs)
- `/health` (health check endpoint)
- `/clubs/api/search` or `/clubs/api/search`-style autocomplete endpoints (back-end search)
- `/clubs/:clubId/images` and `DELETE /:clubId/images/:filename` (image management endpoints)
- `/clubs/join/:id`, `/clubs/leave` (POST actions â€” surface help on the club list/profile UI)
- Many `POST` routes used for form submissions (create/update/delete) â€” implement help on the form pages only, not the POST endpoints themselves.

If a route is purely an AJAX endpoint, add help to the parent page that consumes that endpoint (for example: autocomplete help on the form that uses `/clubs/api/search`).

### Phase 2: Public Pages (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Homepage help popups
- [ ] About page help popups
- [ ] Contact page help popups
