# Automated Draw Creation Implementation Plan

**Project:** Old Man Footy - Automated Draw Creation System  
**Created:** September 29, 2025  
**Status:** Planning Phase  

## Overview

Implement an intelligent draw generation system that automatically creates fair and balanced tournament draws for Masters Rugby League carnivals. The system will support multiple matching algorithms and provide carnival organizers with flexible configuration options to suit their specific tournament requirements.

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ Existing Infrastructure
- [x] **Carnival Model** - Complete carnival information and management
- [x] **CarnivalClub Model** - Club registration and participation tracking
- [x] **CarnivalClubPlayer Model** - Individual player registration with team assignments
- [x] **Club Model** - Club information including location and contact details
- [x] **Admin Interface** - Existing carnival management UI for delegates
- [x] **Authentication System** - Role-based access control for carnival organizers
- [x] **Database Migration System** - Sequelize migrations for schema updates

### üîç Current Draw Management
Currently, draws are managed manually by carnival organizers:
- Draw sheets can be uploaded as images or documents
- No automated draw generation capabilities
- No standardized draw format or structure
- Limited support for complex tournament formats

### ‚ùå Missing Components for Automated Draw Creation
- [ ] **Draw Generation Service** - Core algorithm engine
- [ ] **Draw Configuration Model** - Store organizer preferences and rules
- [ ] **Team Assignment Logic** - Intelligent team grouping algorithms
- [ ] **Draw Visualization** - Generate visual draw sheets
- [ ] **Draw Export/Import** - Standard formats for draw sharing
- [ ] **Conflict Resolution** - Handle scheduling and venue conflicts
- [ ] **Draw Templates** - Pre-configured tournament formats
- [ ] **Historical Analysis** - Learn from past draw performance

## Tournament Format Analysis

### Common Masters Rugby League Tournament Formats

#### 1. **Pool Play + Finals**
- Teams divided into pools/groups
- Round-robin within pools
- Top teams advance to knockout finals
- Most common format for larger carnivals

#### 2. **Straight Knockout**
- Single elimination tournament
- Suitable for time-constrained events
- Simple bracket structure

#### 3. **Swiss System**
- Teams play fixed number of rounds
- Opponents selected based on current standings
- No player elimination

#### 4. **Round Robin**
- Every team plays every other team
- Suitable for smaller tournaments
- Fair but time-intensive

## Draw Generation Algorithms

### Algorithm 1: Random Assignment
**Use Case:** Simple, unbiased draw creation  
**Implementation:** Standard randomization with seeding options

```javascript
class RandomDrawGenerator {
  generateDraw(teams, configuration) {
    // Shuffle teams randomly
    // Apply seeding if configured
    // Create balanced pools/brackets
    // Ensure minimum game guarantees
  }
}
```

### Algorithm 2: Shorts Color Matching
**Use Case:** Prevent strip clashes in games  
**Implementation:** Color-aware team distribution

```javascript
class ColorMatchingDrawGenerator {
  generateDraw(teams, configuration) {
    // Group teams by similar colors
    // Distribute to avoid color clashes
    // Maintain competitive balance
    // Fall back to random if no solution
  }
}
```

### Algorithm 3: Geographic Distribution
**Use Case:** Reduce local rivalries, promote diverse matchups  
**Implementation:** Location-based team separation

```javascript
class GeographicDrawGenerator {
  generateDraw(teams, configuration) {
    // Calculate distances between club locations
    // Minimize local matchups in early rounds
    // Allow natural rivalries in later stages
    // Balance travel considerations
  }
}
```

### Algorithm 4: Hybrid Intelligent Matching
**Use Case:** Multi-criteria optimization  
**Implementation:** Weighted scoring system

```javascript
class IntelligentDrawGenerator {
  generateDraw(teams, configuration) {
    // Score potential matchups based on multiple criteria
    // Apply carnival organizer preferences and weights
    // Optimize for fairness, variety, and logistics
    // Generate multiple options for organizer selection
  }
}
```
