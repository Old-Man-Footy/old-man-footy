### Why Use Your Club's Email Address?
**Each account can only manage one club.** If you use a personal email address and later need to manage multiple clubs, you'll face challenges:

- You'll need to create separate accounts for each club
- Managing multiple accounts can become confusing
- You may lose access to club data if you leave your role

### Best Practices for Email Selection

**For Single Club Management:**
- Use your club's official email address (e.g., president@yourclub.com.au)
- This ensures continuity when leadership changes
- Makes it easier for other club members to identify the account

**For Multiple Club Management:**
- Create separate accounts with each club's official email
- For example: president@club1.com.au and secretary@club2.com.au
- This keeps club data and communications properly separated

**If You Don't Have Club Email Access:**
- Use a personal email that you'll have long-term access to
- Consider setting up a dedicated email for club management
- Document the login details for your successor

### Common Scenarios

**Scenario 1: You're a president managing one club**
✅ **Recommended:** Use president@yourclub.com.au
❌ **Avoid:** Using john.smith@gmail.com

**Scenario 2: You manage multiple clubs**
✅ **Recommended:** Create separate accounts:
- Account 1: admin@eastcoasttigers.com.au
- Account 2: secretary@southernstallions.com.au

❌ **Avoid:** Using one personal email for multiple clubs

**Scenario 3: Your club doesn't have an official email**
✅ **Recommended:** Create a dedicated email like eastcoasttigers.rugby@gmail.com
❌ **Avoid:** Using your personal email if you might manage multiple clubs

## Tips & Best Practices

## Troubleshooting
**"I need to manage a second club but already have an account"**
You'll need to create a new account with a different email address for the second club. Each account can only manage one club.

**"I used my personal email but now want to transfer to club email"**
Contact support to help transfer club ownership to a new account with the club's official email address.
