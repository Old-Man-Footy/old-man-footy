# File Upload Refactor Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the refactoring of the current file upload system from a single, complex middleware to two specialized middlewares: one for gallery uploads (AJAX-based, creates ImageUpload records) and one for form uploads (traditional form posts, saves paths to model fields).

**IMPORTANT**: AVOID RUNNING THE EXISTING UNIT TESTS `npm test` UNTIL THE REFACTOR IS COMPLETE. THE CURRENT TESTS MAY NOT BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE NEW STRUCTURE AND COULD LEAD TO CONFUSION OR MISLEADING RESULTS. WE WILL ADD NEW TESTS AFTER THE REFACTOR IS COMPLETE.

## Current State Analysis
- **Current middleware**: `middleware/upload.mjs` (417 lines, handles all upload types)
- **Gallery uploads**: Used by API routes, creates records in ImageUpload table
- **Form uploads**: Used by web routes, saves file paths to entity model fields (logos, promotional images, documents)
- **Affected routes**: carnivals, clubs, sponsors, admin, API images

## Phase 1: Backup and Assessment
#### Phase 1.1: Create Initial Backup and Assessment
- [x] Create backup: `middleware/upload.mjs` → `middleware/upload.mjs.old`
- [x] Document current middleware exports and their usage patterns
  - Current exports: carnivalUpload, sponsorUpload, clubUpload, logoUpload, imageUpload, documentUpload, avatarUpload, galleryUpload, uploadRaw, handleUploadError, extractUploadContext, fileFilter, processStructuredUpload
  - All use multer.fields() or multer.single() with processStructuredUpload middleware
  - Entity-based storage with content-type subfolders (logos, gallery, documents, avatars)
  - [ ] `galleryUpload` - used by API routes
  - [ ] `carnivalUpload` - used by carnival routes
  - [ ] `clubUpload` - used by club routes  
  - [ ] `sponsorUpload` - used by sponsor routes
  - [ ] `handleUploadError` - error handling middleware
  - [ ] `processStructuredUpload` - post-processing middleware
- [x] Identify all routes currently using upload middleware
  
  **Route Analysis Complete:**
  
  **Form-based Upload Routes:**
  - `routes/sponsors.mjs`: sponsorUpload, handleUploadError (create/update sponsors)
  - `routes/clubs.mjs`: clubUpload, sponsorUpload, handleUploadError (club profile, sponsor management)  
  - `routes/carnivals.mjs`: carnivalUpload, handleUploadError (create/edit carnivals)
  - `routes/admin.mjs`: clubUpload, carnivalUpload, handleUploadError (admin management)
  
  **Gallery/AJAX Upload Routes:**
  - `routes/api/images.mjs`: galleryUpload, handleUploadError (gallery image uploads)
  
  **Testing Usage:**
  - `tests/middleware/upload.test.mjs`: extractUploadContext, fileFilter, handleUploadError
  
  **Key Route Endpoints:**
  - POST `/sponsors` (create), POST `/sponsors/:id` (update) 
  - POST `/clubs/{id}/profile` (club profile)
  - POST `/clubs/{id}/sponsors/add` (club sponsor creation)
  - POST `/clubs/{id}/sponsors/:sponsorId/edit` (club sponsor edit)
  - POST `/carnivals/new` (carnival creation)
  - POST `/carnivals/:id/edit` (carnival edit)
  - POST `/admin/clubs` (admin club management)
  - POST `/admin/carnivals` (admin carnival management)
  - POST `/api/images/upload` (gallery upload)
  - DELETE `/api/images/:id`, GET `/api/images/carnival/:carnivalId`, GET `/api/images/club/:clubId`, GET `/api/images/carousel`
- [x] Test current functionality to establish baseline
  
  **Baseline Testing Complete:**
  
  **Current Upload System Working Correctly:**
  - ✅ Form uploads working for sponsors, clubs, carnivals (logo fields)
  - ✅ Gallery uploads working for AJAX image uploads via API
  - ✅ Content-type subfolder organization (logos/, gallery/, documents/, avatars/)
  - ✅ Entity-based storage (clubs/{id}/, carnivals/{id}/, sponsors/{id}/, users/{id}/)
  - ✅ File validation (image types for galleries, documents for forms)
  - ✅ Error handling via handleUploadError middleware
  - ✅ Post-processing via processStructuredUpload middleware
  
  **Key Configuration Validated:**
  - Multer diskStorage with dynamic destination paths
  - File size limits and type validation working

### **Phase 7: Frontend Implementation & UI Integration** ✅
* **Task 7.1: Create Reusable Uploader Partials & Client-Side Script** ✅
  - [x] Create views/partials/_imageUploader.ejs. This partial contains HTML structure for drag-and-drop area with image preview pane, configurable with parameters like fieldName, labelText, currentImageUrl. **Converted to single-file handling** - removed promotional section, simplified for single logo/image uploads only.
  - [x] Create views/partials/_documentUploader.ejs. This will be a simple file input for handling multiple documents, displaying a list of selected files. It will be used for the Carnival drawFiles field. (Already exists and working) **Inline styles removed** - extracted to external CSS.
  - [x] Create a new client-side script public/js/image-uploader.js. This script contains all JavaScript logic to power the image uploader partials, including handling drag/drop events, reading files with FileReader to generate previews, file validation, and updating file lists. **Completely converted to single-file handling** - all methods updated for single file operations.
* **Task 7.2: Database & Model Investigation (Carnival)**  
  - [x] Investigate the Carnival model and database schema to confirm the usage of drawFileURL.  
  - [x] **Decision Point:** Database investigation reveals drawFileURL has no data but is actively used in views (show.ejs, edit.ejs) and email service. **Decision: Preserve drawFileURL** to maintain existing functionality. New drawFiles JSON will be used for multiple files, drawFileURL for single legacy file compatibility.  
* **Task 7.3: Integrate Uploader into Sponsor Views** ✅ 
  - [x] In clubs/edit-sponsor.ejs, add \<%- include('../partials/_imageUploader', { ... }) %\> for image uploading.  
  - [x] Configure the partial to use the correct fieldName ('logo') and pass the existing sponsor.logoUrl for the initial preview.
  - [x] In sponsors/edit.ejs, add image uploader for sponsor logo uploads with consistent configuration.  
* **Task 7.4: Integrate Uploader into Club Views** ✅ 
  - [x] In clubs/edit.ejs, replace the existing logo input with the _imageUploader partial.  
  - [x] Configure the partial with fieldName: 'logo' and pass club.logoUrl.  
* **Task 7.5: Integrate Uploaders into Carnival Views** ✅  
  - [x] In carnivals/edit.ejs, add two instances of the _imageUploader partial:  
    - One for the **Logo** (fieldName: 'logo', currentImageUrl: carnival.clubLogoUrl).  
    - One for the **Promotional Image** (fieldName: 'promotionalImage', currentImageUrl: carnival.promotionalImageURL).  
  - [x] In carnivals/edit.ejs, add the _documentUploader partial for the **Draw Files** (fieldName: 'drawDocument'). The backend will be configured to accept multiple files for this field name and the controller will aggregate them into the drawFiles JSON array.
* **Task 7.6: CSS & Styling Cleanup** ✅
  - [x] Extract all inline styles from uploader partials to external CSS
  - [x] Add comprehensive uploader styles to public/css/styles.css
  - [x] Ensure consistent styling across both image and document uploaders

## Phase 8: Testing and Validation 🔄
- [x] **Task 8.1: Gallery Upload Infrastructure Testing** ✅
  - [x] Verify API endpoint `/api/images/upload` exists and is functional
  - [x] Confirm galleryUpload middleware integration for AJAX uploads

  - [x] Verify carnivalId/clubId validation logic
  - [x] Confirm ImageUpload model integration
  - [x] Validate permission system (admin + ownership checks)
  - [x] Verify DELETE endpoint `/api/images/:id` with proper permissions
  - [x] **Result: Complete gallery upload API system discovered and validated**

### **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED** 🚨
**Directory Structure Incompatibility Discovered:**
- `galleryUpload.mjs` creates entity-specific directories: `public/uploads/carnivals/{id}/gallery`, `public/uploads/clubs/{id}/gallery`
