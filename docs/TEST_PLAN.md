## 🛠️ **PHASE 3 DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE**

### **Available Test Commands** 🧪

#### **Standard Test Commands**
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- "filename.test.mjs"
```

#### **🆕 Debug Test Commands**
```bash
# Debug all tests (attach debugger on port 9229)
npm run test:debug

# Debug specific test file
npm run test:debug-file -- "filename.test.mjs"

# Debug with custom port
node --inspect-brk=9230 ./node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs --no-coverage --reporter=verbose -- "filename.test.mjs"
```

#### **Debugger Attachment Instructions** 🔍
1. **Visual Studio Code**:
   - Run `npm run test:debug` or `npm run test:debug-file -- "filename.test.mjs"`
   - Open VS Code's Debug panel (Ctrl+Shift+D)
   - Click "Run and Debug" → "Node.js: Attach"
   - Or create a launch configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "node",
     "request": "attach",
     "name": "Attach to Vitest",
     "port": 9229,
     "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"]
   }
   ```

2. **Chrome DevTools**:
   - Run the debug command
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://inspect`
   - Click "inspect" next to your Node.js process
   - Set breakpoints in your test files

3. **Debug Specific Sponsor Controller Tests**:
   ```bash
   # Debug sponsor controller tests specifically
   npm run test:debug-file -- "sponsor.controller.test.mjs"
   
   # Debug with watch mode (for iterative debugging)
   node --inspect-brk=9229 ./node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs --no-coverage --reporter=verbose --watch -- "sponsor.controller.test.mjs"
   ```

#### **Debug Best Practices** 📋
- **Set Breakpoints**: Place breakpoints in test files, controller methods, or mock functions
- **Inspect Variables**: Use debugger to inspect `req`, `res`, `next` objects and mock data
- **Step Through**: Step through controller logic to understand execution flow
- **Console Debugging**: Use `console.log()` or `debugger` statements for quick insights
- **Mock Inspection**: Debug mock function calls to verify correct parameters are passed
