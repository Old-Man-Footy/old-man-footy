## Next Development Priorities

### HIGH PRIORITY
1. **Complete EJS Templates** - Create/enhance all view files
2. **Implement Styling** - Green/Gold theme, responsive design
3. **File Upload System** - Logo, images, document uploads
4. **Email Service Integration** - Complete notification system

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
1. **MySideline Integration** - Automated event fetching
2. **Enhanced UI/UX** - Calendar views, advanced filtering
3. **Testing Implementation** - Unit and integration tests

### LOW PRIORITY
1. **Performance Optimization** - Caching, query optimization
2. **Advanced Features** - Volunteer tracking, social integration
3. **Production Deployment** - Cloud setup, monitoring

## Development Notes
- Database connection string in `.env` uses local MongoDB
- Session secret and email credentials need production values
- All models use Mongoose with proper indexing
- Authentication system is fully functional
- Error handling middleware is implemented
- Flash message system is working

## Key Architectural Decisions Made
1. **MongoDB over SQL Server** - Better fit for Node.js ecosystem
2. **EJS over React/Vue** - Simpler server-side rendering approach  
3. **Invitation-based registration** - Security-focused user management
4. **State-based filtering** - Australia-wide event management
5. **Soft delete approach** - Data preservation with isActive flags
